/* dualtsplus_fcl(FF) has the variables FF[1] from FF. It also has variables

   The clauses of dualts_fcl(FF) are canonical translations. They are
   translations of:
     - (C <-> dts(i)) for all clauses C of FF with index i.
     - the disjunction of all dts(i).
     - (l <-> T) for every literal l occurring in FF[2].
       T is the conjunction of -dts(i) where -l is in C with index i.
   Thus we obtain per C one clause of length |C|+1. We also obtain |C| clauses
   of length 2. We obtain one clause of length literal_degree_cs(FF[2],-l)
   for every literal l in FF[2]. Finally we have one clause of length |FF|.

     - mirror-clauses.
     - binary clauses (with the natural order on them, given by the
       order of clauses in FF and the order of the literals in C in FF),
